3D Fish Simulation
Gray Wolf, December 2017
--------------------------------------------------

This program simulates 3D fish swimming around the ocean

Click the screen to add more fish (maximum of 4)
- Limit of 4 due to resource hungry fish :)
- If you want more fish you can change maxFish on line 46 within the Scene object

Move your mouse to take control of the yellow/orange fish

The fish get:
- larger when they are swimming towards you
- smaller when they are swimming away

The closer fish will always appear in front

NOTE: If you take a spin-off you will need to gointo settings below your spin-off and change the width and height to 600, then refresh your page :)
